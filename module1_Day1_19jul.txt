Statically typed languages
1.A language is statically typed if the type of a variable is known at compile time.(For some languages this means that you as the programmer must specify what type each variable )
2.ex:Java, C, C++

Dynamically typed languages
1.A language is dynamically typed if the type is associated with run-time values.(This means that you as a programmer can write a little quicker because you do not have to specify types every time)
2.Examples: Perl, Ruby, Python, PHP, JavaScript

--Scripting languages are programming languages that don't require an explicit compilation step.
--Is unstructure subset of programming language. It is generally interpreted.
--A scripting language usually sits behind some programming language. Scripting languages usually have less access to the computers native abilities since they run on a subset of the original programming language
--Scripting languages are usually slower than programming languages.
--Examples of scripting language:JavaScript,Perl,bbscript
--Examples of Programming language:c,c++,java
Note:All scripting languages are programming languages.Languages are not classed as script or not - it entirely depends on the execution environment.

Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

$Multiplexing:
-HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other
-HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data by splitting data into binary-code messages and numbering these messages 

$Server Push
-HTTP/2 allowes a server to "push" content to a client before the client asks for it whereas HTTP/1.1 will not push before asking

$Header compression
-To speed up web performance, both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 compress HTTP messages to make them smaller.
-TTP/2 uses a more advanced compression method called HPACK that eliminates redundant information in HTTP header packets.

$Weighted Priortization
-This allows developers to decide which page resources will load first, every time.
